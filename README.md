In this project you can find the:
(a) Labview project used for implementating the intelligent controller for a single-link flexible maniipulator prototype;
(b) and all the results obtained by this implementation considering the intelligent and adaptive approaches.

The columns of the results file are divided as follows:
[1] time
[2] desired angular position of the hub
[3] angular position of the hub
[4] tracking error of the hub
[5] desired angular velocity of the hub
[6] angular velocity of the hub
[7] desired angular accelaration of the hub
[8] angular accelaration of the hub
[9] absolute tip accelaration
[10] control signal
